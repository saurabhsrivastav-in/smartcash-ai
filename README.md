## 💡 The Value Proposition (PM Perspective)
Traditional tools often fail during "The Remittance Gap"—where payment data is unstructured or incomplete. SmartCash AI solves the "Black Box" problem through:

1. **Transparency:** Explainable AI (XAI) allows analysts to see exactly *why* a match was made via confidence scoring.
2. **Agility:** A lightweight, API-first architecture that integrates faster than legacy enterprise monoliths.
3. **Actionability:** A "Human-in-the-Loop" Workbench to resolve short-pays and deductions in seconds.
