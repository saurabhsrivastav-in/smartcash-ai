## 💡 The Value Proposition (PM Perspective)
Traditional Cash App tools often fail during "The Remittance Gap"—where payment data is messy or incomplete. SmartCash AI achieves a **95% Straight-Through Processing (STP) rate** by focusing on:

1.  **Transparency:** Analysts see exactly *why* a match was made (Confidence Scoring).
2.  **Agility:** A lightweight, API-first architecture that integrates faster than enterprise monoliths.
3.  **Actionability:** A dedicated workbench to handle short-pays and deductions in seconds, not hours.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Intelligent Matching Engine:** Multi-factor logic (Fuzzy Name Matching + Amount Validation).
- **Analyst Workbench:** A "Human-in-the-loop" UI to review "Suggested Matches" (90-95% confidence).
- **Deduction Management:** Automated flagging of short-payments for dispute resolution.
- **Executive Insights:** Real-time tracking of Unapplied Cash and STP trends.
