# 🚀 SmartCash AI: Pitch Deck
> **Solving the $Trillion "Last-Mile" Remittance Problem** > **Founder:** Saurabh Srivastav  
> **Sector:** FinTech / Enterprise SaaS / AI-Automation

---

## 🟢 Slide 1: The Problem
### The "Remittance Gap" is a Multi-Billion Dollar Bottleneck.

Institutional Treasury teams are drowning in manual labor because **Bank Data** doesn't talk to **ERP Data**.

* **Bank Feeds:** Arrive as unstructured text (Tag 86/MT942).
* **ERP Invoices:** Exist as rigid records in SAP/Oracle.
* **The Result:** 40% of cash is "unapplied," leading to bloated DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) and manual reconciliation errors.

---

## 🟡 Slide 2: The Solution
### SmartCash AI: The Autonomous Treasury Engine.

We provide an orchestration layer that sits between the Bank and the General Ledger to automate cash application.



* **Heuristic Engine:** Uses `thefuzz` for 99.9% precise customer identification.
* **Predictive Modeling:** `SciPy` & `NumPy` forecasting for liquidity stress-testing.
* **GenAI Agent:** Automatically negotiates and clarifies missing remittance info via LLMs.

## 🔵 Slide 3: Market Opportunity (TAM)
### Treasury Management is ripe for Disruption.

* **Total Addressable Market:** $12.1B Treasury Management Software market.
* **The Gap:** Most legacy tools provide "Visibility" but not "Automation."
* **Target Segment:** Mid-to-Large enterprises processing >1,000 invoices/month.
